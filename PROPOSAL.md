- [Yelp](http://www.yelp.ca/search?find_desc=Chip+Wagon&find_loc=Ottawa%2C+ON)

	yelp.ca touts itself as being “the fun and easy way to find and talk about great (and not so great) local businesses”. A search for “Chip Trucks” reveals a list of 17 results but only eight of those are chip wagons, the rest are a mishmash of restaurant listings. 
	The review and ratings are helpful but the site is inconsistent – some of the chip wagons have photographs, others don’t. There is a free mobile app available.

	### Differences
	My app will be more focused: its sole purpose is to locate chip trucks in Ottawa. Users won’t have to wade through irrelevant listings to find what they want. The look and feel of my app will be more consistent and attractive.


- [House Numbers](http://www.housenumbers.ca/ottawachiptrucks.html)
	
	housenumbers.ca has a page devoted to a handful of chip trucks in Ottawa but, upon closer inspection, it appears to be a promotional website for a local photographer. 
	Each of the eight chip trucks listed has a very large photograph. The only information about the truck’s location is written below the photo and poor programming has caused half of the text to be illegible. At the bottom of the page there is a cornucopia of links to random photographs – everything from antique shops and tall ships to the Ottawa Tulip Festival

	### Differences

	My chip truck locator will be more usable. Instead of having the option to link to multiple other pages it will be focused on giving users the information they came for: the location of chip trucks in Ottawa. 
	My app will not hog precious download time by using giant photographs and the information will be clear and easy to read.

- [Ottawa Foodies](http://ottawafoodies.com/tag/7)
	
	Ottawa Foodies provides user-generated information about a vast array of eating establishments throughout the city. Searching for “chip trucks” brings you to a long list of vendors, not all of which are chip trucks (Booster Juice falls into this category, for instance). Clicking on a name in the list brings you to a full page of user comments and reviews about that establishment. 
	Addresses are not always listed or easy to find. Although user reviews can be helpful, this site has a lot of long ones making it time consuming to read through.
	
	### Differences

	My chip truck locator will be more focused and only show the location of chip wagons. It will also be very easy for users to find the addresses of each truck.

## User research

Ottawa Chip Truck Finder is primarily targeted to people who live and work in the city with construction workers, delivery truck drivers and couriers among the main focus. While most people who work in the city know where the closest chip truck is in relation to their office building, workers who “rove” for a living don’t always know which end of town they’ll be in when hunger strikes.
