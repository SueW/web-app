# Progress Report

### 1. What features have you accomplished in the past week?
	
I added some documentation.


### 2. Did you achieve the previous week’s goals?

Yes.

### 3. What are your goals for this week?

To try and complete all the required documentation.


### 4. What concepts or techniques did you learn?

A basic reminder to save my work properly. I worked like mad to design the image of a chip truck for my main header but forgot to save the original (editable) file in a safe place (I left it on the desktop) and poof! it vanished.

### 5. What parts of the application, in the past week, were enjoyable?

Testing other people's apps and getting feedback on mine.


### 6. What parts of the application, in the past week, were frustrating?

Losing the editable image I designed sucked. I got feedback that I should tweak it...but now I can't.


### 7. Did you have to radically alter something you’d finished previously?

No.
